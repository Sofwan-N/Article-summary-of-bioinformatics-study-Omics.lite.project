Exploring Core Genes by Comparative Transcriptomics Analysis for Early Diagnosis, 
Prognosis, and Therapies of Colorectal Cancer 
Research Background : Colorectal Cancer (CRC) became a biggest challenge by its high 
morbidity rate. Early detection rates may increase the survivability of patients. Thus, in this study 
the researchers investigated the cause of cancer by comparative transcriptomics analysis. The 
researchers are also investigating early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapies of CRC by 
bioinformatics tools and databases.  
Abstract : The research mainly focuses on analytical and statistical studies for CRC using open 
access databases. At first, they gathered 252 common Differentially Expressed Genes (cDEG) 
between control and cancer. The top ten genes become the core genes (CGs) selected by using 
the GO & KEGG pathway. The CGs revealed regulatory pathway identification, associated with 
other disease, and functional & pathway. Statistical analysis became supplementary data for 
target prediction before jumping into molecular docking and MD. The CGs were docked with over 
150 CRC-drugs respectively and they selected four best interactions. Molecular dynamic studies 
played a role in stability of drug performance. Therefore, this study aims for a suitable plan for 
CRC patients. 
Output : Integrated bioinformatic and statistical approach on developing suitable plan for CRC
